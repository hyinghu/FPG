matching algorithms:

Price-Time Priority: This is the most basic and widely used matching algorithm. It matches buy and sell orders based on the best price available in the order book and then on a first-come, first-served basis.

Pro-Rata: This matching algorithm takes into account the quantity of each order and matches them proportionally. For example, if two orders are available at the same price, the algorithm will match them in proportion to the quantity of each order.

FIFO: This algorithm matches orders based on the order in which they were placed. It matches the oldest order first, regardless of its price or quantity.

Dark Pool: This algorithm is used in a type of trading venue called a "dark pool," which is designed to facilitate large orders without revealing them to the market. The algorithm matches buy and sell orders based on the midpoint of the bid-ask spread.

VWAP: Volume-weighted average price (VWAP) is an algorithm used to execute large orders over time. It calculates the average price of a security over a specific time period, weighted by the trading volume during that period.

QtWallet is a GUI interface to test ETH and BTC kernel down to the ECDSA multi-part signature algorithm on private, testnet, or maybe public mainnet.

NOTE: for experimental purposes only. To ensure the feasibility of the ECDSA (and EdDSA) algorithm within the MS Wallet across various cryptocurrency platforms.
